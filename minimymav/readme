Flask implementation of a student enrollment system (MyMav is the application used in our school hence the name minimymav)

This Project is supposed to be run in a dockercontainer, the needed dockerfiles are included. 
This Started as a assignment for my course Cloud Computing at UTA and I am still bringing some new changes to the code. 

I have run it in Amazon EC2 with docker installed in the machine .

For instructions about how to get started with the project email me :mukundcs1611@gmail.com
